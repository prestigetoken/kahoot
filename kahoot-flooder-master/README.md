# Kahoot Flooder

Flood a Kahoot on your computer using only Chrome! Unlike the online Kahoot flooding websites, this extension uses your computer, and the offical kahoot website to add players, and therefore will always work. After entering the options, this extension will open the number of tabs you chose and then automatically enter the code and nickname.

[Available for free download on the Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kahoot-flooder/nebfgdmbcckgdicofllbbkibfihmcddl)
